    <p>
      I thought long and hard about what kind of gift I could give you today. <br><br>
  
      Flowers fade, chocolates get eaten, and even the prettiest things lose their charm over time... <br><br>
  
      But what I want to give you is something that lasts — my love, my loyalty, my admiration, and all the little moments that make you feel cherished. 💖<br><br>
  
      So here’s my real gift: a promise.<br><br>
  
      I promise to always celebrate your happiness as my own, to support you when things get tough, to laugh at your silly jokes, and hold your hand through every season life throws at us.<br><br>
  
      This little webpage might not be much, but it’s made with a whole lot of love — just like everything I hope to share with you, every day. <br><br>
  
      Happy Birthday, Lachu. You’re my favorite gift this world ever gave me. 🎀

    <h2>💌 My Letter:</h2>
  <p>
    Dear Lachu,<br><br>

    Today is special not just because it's your birthday, but because it's a reminder that this world was blessed with someone as beautiful, kind, and sweet as you. 💖<br><br>

    Every moment with you feels like a quiet kind of magic — a warmth that never fades, a comfort I always crave. You have this way of making everything better, of making me better. I still smile just thinking about you.<br><br>

    Whether we’re joking about the smallest things or sitting in silence, you somehow make every second feel meaningful. You don’t even try — it’s just who you are. And I’m so lucky to know you, to care about you, to be part of your story, even in a small way.<br><br>

    On this birthday, I just want you to know: you’re loved more than you realize. Not just today, but always. ❤️<br><br>

    Happy Birthday, my sunshine.<br><br>

    Yours always,<br>
    Adi

    <h2>🔐 Secret Message</h2>
  <p>
    So... you found the hidden part of this little surprise. You always were the clever one. 😉<br><br>

    I didn’t want to say this out loud — not in the gift or the letter — but here, just between us, I want you to know something deeper. 💬<br><br>

    You’re not just someone I care about. You're someone I admire, respect, and feel completely at peace with. You have this rare magic — you make me feel safe, understood, and inspired all at once.<br><br>

    Sometimes I look at you and wonder how I got this lucky. Like… what did I do in this life (or maybe a past one) to deserve you? Because no matter how beautiful this world is, it feels more complete when you're in it.<br><br>

    So here's my secret: loving you is the best part of my day. Every day. 💖<br><br>

    Keep this message close — it’s my favorite truth.

    Happy Birthday once again, my love. 🎀<br><br>

    <strong>PS:</strong> Also… if I could, I’d be giving you kisses right now. The soft, slow kind that makes you forget about the world for a minute. Just saying. 😘<br><br>

    <strong>PPS:</strong> I love you so much, Lachu. 💖<br><br>

    <strong>PPPS:</strong> If I were there right now... I wouldn’t be letting you go anytime soon. I’d pull you close, whisper how good you look tonight, and kiss you like I mean every second of it — because I do. <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: #d63384; margin-top: 30px;">
      <strong>PPPPS:</strong> If I had you with me right now, birthday girl…<br>
      I wouldn’t waste a second. I’d press you up against me, trace my fingers down your back real slow, and kiss you like I’ve been starving for it. Because I am.<br><br>
    
      I’d take my time exploring every inch of that beautiful smile, that soft skin, that voice that drives me insane. You’d be gasping my name before the candles even melt. <br><br>
    
      And when I finally let you breathe again… it wouldn’t be over. Oh no, baby — it’d just be the beginning.
